## I created a simple web server using express framework in node js. 

>> Now we need to change the configuration file in node js, and add a user so it can be returned by the get HTTP request we are initiating. 

With Node’s environment variables, we can configure our applications outside of our codebase. Environment variables provide information about the environment 
in which the process is running. We use Node environment variables to handle sensitive data like passwords, which we shouldn’t hard code, or configuration details that might change between runs,
like what port a server should listen on. In Node.js these special variables are accessible on the global process.env object.
